We use 2 node trackers namely, prev and next_node to keep track of previous node and next node wrt current head. 
Prev is initially None
Next node is current head.next
Current prev is assigned to current head.next as prev node will be next node in reversed list
Then current head becomes the previous node and current next_node becomes head.
This goes on until head becomes None and since prev is pointing to the head of the list at this point, we return prev
